# Return

**A 2D action RPG prototype** built in **Godot 4**, created by **Magnus** and **Philip**.

## Overview

_Return_ is a dark fantasy, Nordic-inspired project exploring themes of plague, despair, and renewal.  
The goal of the prototype is to eventually demonstrate a complete gameplay loop — from intro and player control to combat, exploration, and a boss encounter.

This repository currently contains the early development work toward that prototype, including core movement, combat systems, and asset integration.

## Roles

**Magnus – Programmer / Gameplay Developer**  
Responsible for all programming and technical implementation.

- Builds gameplay systems (movement, combat, AI, interaction).
- Integrates assets and sets up levels in Godot.
- Focuses on mechanical feel and playtesting.

**Philip – 2D Game Artist & Narrative Developer**  
Responsible for visual and narrative design.

- Creates sprites, tilesets, UI art, and visual effects.
- Defines the visual tone, atmosphere, and story direction.

## Current Goal

Develop a **Proof of Concept (v0.1)** featuring:

- Player movement, combat, and stance switching.
- One playable area with interactive elements (doors, NPC, chest).
- Standard enemies and a single boss fight.
- Symbolic ending sequence establishing the game’s tone.

## Engine & Tools

- **Engine:** Godot 4
- **Language:** GDScript
- **Art:** Hand-drawn 2D pixel assets
- **Version Control:** Git / GitHub

## Status

Early prototype stage — gameplay systems under active development.
